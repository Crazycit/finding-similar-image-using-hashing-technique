# Finding Similar Image Using Hashing Technique

## About the project:

This project uses CALTECH-101 dataset. The data could be found here ðŸ‘‰ http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/101_ObjectCategories.tar.gz

The project uses image hashing process to uniquely give a number to an image based on it's content.

It uses Vantage-Point Tree has been used to reduce the search time. A vantage-point tree is a metric tree that segregates data in a metric space by choosing a position in the space and partitioning the data points into two parts: those points that are nearer to the vantage point than a threshold, and those points that are not.
